# DroneSole

Control a drone with your console, type commands to be carried out, and get to the end of the level. Beware, the path may not be safe, and with the power of [REDACTED] there are multiple ways to complete each, so use your resources wisely.

Type away through 10 puzzle levels to reach the end, run from enemies, move through doors, and break each level as much as you want to! (I suggest just use the embed, fullscreen can mess up some formatting)


### Instructions

press the [~] key (no shift) to open up a console that controls your drone
type commands into the console, suggestions for commands will show up
(And yep, you HAVE to cheat to complete some of the levels, at least I think so...)

As always, have fun!


### Details

Developed in JavaScript using the p5.js clientside library for graphics. 

*The game is in development, though progress will be slow due to other commitments.*
